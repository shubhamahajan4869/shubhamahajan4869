- 👋 Hi, I’m @shubhamahajan4869
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Database management systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things which would enhance my skills.

In life I have always strived to be more diverse, by taking up responsibilities that challenge who I am and what I’m becoming. As a natural consequence of this, I have been actively involved in managing events and leading people.
Since childhood, I was always encouraged to dream big, and to work hard so as to achieve my goals. This enabled me to excel in school and in various sports and cultural activities. My years at VNIT Nagpur equipped me with the soft skills imperative for managerial roles, by actively participating and co-ordinating a large scale event in my own college. I held roles in Corporate Relations which improved my demeanour and taught me the dynamics of management.
While working with Hindustan Zinc Limited, I learned to utilize both the technical and managerial skills for the betterment of my organisation. As a shift engineer leading a team of 25 members, most of whom were contract workers and far more experienced than myself, I was responsible to support the running of the plant. Apart from this I successfully completed two Lean Six Sigma Projects, resulting in substantial monetary and environmental profits for the unit. Also during this stint, I developed an interest in understanding the working of a corporate entity, which eventually led me to start one of my own start-ups.
From the very first day of college, I was keen to know how certain aspects of Organizational management work. It prompted me to work on my start-up EXCELSIOR, which helped me understand the nuances involved in the functioning of an organization. Its subsidiary, Crazy Chimp is an E-commerce brand apparel store which sells Anime merchandise.
